**PSP notes:** runs on EmulatorJS's nightly core channel (the stable channel has a known hardware-rendering bug); defaults to the JIT CPU core rather than the slower IR JIT interpreter PPSSPP itself ships as its safe-but-slow default, since JIT measurably reduces audio grain during normal gameplay. Threaded WASM (requires the COOP/COEP headers this app already ships) and rewind is disabled outright — see `emulator-backbone.js` for the full reasoning on both.

## Features

**Core**
- Save states — save and load anytime
- Rewind — per-core tuned buffer sizes (PS1: 512MB, N64/GBA/SNES: 256MB, NES/GB/GBC/Genesis: 128MB). Disabled outright for PSP — it's already the heaviest core here, and periodic full-state snapshots for rewind cost more than they're worth on it (see PSP notes below)
- Cover art — auto-fetched via libretro thumbnail CDN
- Fullscreen — native + pseudo-fullscreen with iPhone notch support
- Gamepad support — plug in a controller and go
- Keyboard shortcuts — press `?` in-app for the cheat sheet
- Offline play — full PWA with service worker caching

**Library**
- ROM library with metadata stored in IndexedDB
- ROM binaries stored in OPFS for fast local access
- Playtime tracking and game history

**BIOS Management**
- Upload and store BIOS files locally (OPFS)
- Required: PS1, Sega CD, Saturn
- Optional: NDS, PSP

**Themes**
- 8 free themes: Deep Space (default), Nintendo NES, Super Nintendo, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation
- 8 premium themes: DOOM, Dreamcast, Cyber Neon, Virtual Boy, GBA SP Cobalt, Sega Saturn, Neo Geo MVS, Famicom Disk
- Custom theme editor (premium) — pick your own background + accent colour, live preview
- CRT Screen Texture — subtle scanlines, curved-edge vignette, and a theme-tinted phosphor glow layered into the background on every theme. Pure CSS (no DOM overlay, never sits on top of anything, can't affect legibility); toggle off in Settings → App if you'd rather not see it

**Linkup Room**
- P2P room (up to 4 people) via PeerJS — no server, direct peer-to-peer
- Share a save state — pick from your saved states (with screenshot previews); recipients are asked to confirm before it's applied to their Quick Save, and it's never guessed onto a game they don't own
- Share a file — screenshots, cheat files, config exports, anything else, straight to the recipient's device
- Does not share ROMs or game files of any kind — this app never facilitates ROM distribution over Linkup Room or otherwise

## Tech Stack

- **[EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org)** (libretro cores) — the actual emulation engine. All emulation happens here; ROM Player is a frontend around it.
- **[coops_emulator_backbone](https://github.com/coops-emulator/coops_emulator_backbone)** — our own wrapper around EmulatorJS (`emulator-backbone.js`), used to boot every system it covers. Replaced this app's previous hand-rolled `EJS_*` global wiring with a promise-based `loadGame()` API, a verified system-id registry, and actionable errors instead of silent black screens. Systems it doesn't cover yet (Virtual Boy, Intellivision, Vectrex, MSX) fall back to the original direct wiring.
- **PeerJS** — P2P File Exchange
- **Supabase** — auth + user profiles + premium status
- **Cloudflare Pages** — hosting + edge functions
- **IndexedDB + OPFS** — local ROM and save state storage
- **Service Worker** — offline support + PWA caching

---

## Credits

- **[EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org)** does all the actual emulation (the libretro cores, the WASM runtime, the loader). ROM Player and coops_emulator_backbone are both just frontends around it — full credit to the EmulatorJS project and the libretro cores it bundles.
- **[coops_emulator_backbone](https://github.com/coops-emulator/coops_emulator_backbone)** is our own EmulatorJS wrapper, developed alongside this app; `emulator-backbone.js` in this repo is a vendored build of it.

---

## Deployment

```bash
# Stamp a new version and deploy
sh deploy.sh
```

Version timestamps are generated at deploy time (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` UTC) and must be written **identically, simultaneously, to all five references**: `APP_VERSION` in `index.html`, the `emulator-backbone.js?v=` cache-bust query string (appears in both `index.html` and `sw.js`), `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js`, and `version.json`. Never reuse an old timestamp, and never update a subset of these — a mismatch is what causes cache/update bugs, not just an old timestamp.

---

## Notes

- ROM files are never uploaded to any server — everything stays on your device
- BIOS files are stored locally in OPFS, never transmitted
- Premium validation is handled server-side via Cloudflare Workers + Supabase
